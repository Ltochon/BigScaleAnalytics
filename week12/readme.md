# Graph analytics with networkx

In this lab we will introduce the __networkx__ package, which is a Python package to create and study complex networks. You will get the chance to apply the concepts
you saw in the lecture on simple graphs. The agenda of this lab will be:

1. Creating a simple graph from scratch using networkx.
2. Visualizing graphs.
3. Computing different properties of a graph: degree distribution, diameter, shortest path, betweenness centerality, etc.
4. Computing the number of connected components in a graph.
5. Community detection.

* The material of this lab is inspired from the Applied Data Analysis course from EPFL ([link to the tutorial of the course](https://github.com/epfl-ada/2020/tree/master/Tutorials)).
