# Data cleaning using Google Cloud Dataprep

Just like data collection, data preparation can be a very time-consuming task for data scientists. In this week, we will see how to use a dedicated tool, Cloud Dataprep (by Trifacta), to make data exploration and cleaning more intuitive and eventually faster.

## Goals

* Become aware of the challenges surrounding data cleaning
* Use Cloud Dataprep to improve the quality of a dataset

## Lab Structure

**Hour 1**:

1. Questions about last week's lab?
2. Questions about the project?
3. Brief recap of data cleaning
4. Cloud Dataprep walkthrough

**Hour 2**:

5. Exercise: improve the quality of a dataset (approx. 20 minutes in breakout rooms)
6. Exercise debriefing

In case we finish the lab earlier, students can use the remaining time to work on their project.

## Walkthroughs

**Cloud Dataprep**:

* What is Cloud Dataprep and why use such a tool?
* Accessing Dataprep: From the side menu of your Google Cloud console, go to _Big Data_ > _Dataprep_.
* **Using Dataprep**:
  * Data upload
  * Data exploration
  * Flows, recipes, steps
* **Transformations**:
  * Changing data types
  * Renaming/moving/deleting columns
  * Handling missing values
  * Formatting strings
  * Nesting/splitting
  * Extraction
  * Substitution
  * Computation
  * And many more...

## Exercises

No notebook this week. The exercise will done directly in Cloud Dataprep using the data found in the GitHub folder.
