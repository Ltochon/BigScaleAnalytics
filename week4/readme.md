# Elastic Cloud

This week, you will learn about Elastic Cloud, a platform which enables search and analytics for both structured and unstructured data.

If you want to broaden your knowledge beyond this lab, the Elastic website provides many [video tutorials](https://www.elastic.co/videos/).

## Goals

* Become aware of the various components of the Elastic stack and their respective roles
* Explore the Kibana dashboard, the web interface that allows you to explore your data
* Get acquainted with the Query DSL search syntax in Elastic Search
* Leverage Elasticsearch's "Edge n-gram" tokenizer to create an autocompletion functionality

2. Elastic Cloud walkthrough: Elastic Search and Kibana
3. Introducion to query DSL using the Kibana Dev Tools Console
4. Connecting your colab notebook to Elastic Cloud and using the elasticsearch-dsl package
5. Create an autocomplete functionality for your index using the Edge n-gram tokenizer in the Kibana Dev Tools Console
