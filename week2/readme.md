# SQL in Python

In this week, we will do a quick recap of the SQL syntax and see how we can run SQL queries from Python.

## Goals

* Get reacquainted with the SQL syntax to prepare you for the upcoming assignment
* Create and query a SQLite database using Python

## Lab Structure

**Hour 1**:

1. Questions about last week's lab?
2. Questions about the project?
3. SQL recap
4. Basic queries (10-15 min. in breakout rooms)

**Hour 2**:

5. Solutions (presented by students)
6. Advanced queries ( 20 min. in breakout rooms)
7. Solutions (presented by students)

## Walkthroughs

**SQL recap**: [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)

1. Basic SELECT-FROM- WHERE
2. GROUP BY's
3. JOIN's

**SQL in Python**: Open this week's notebook [`bsa_lab_week_2_exercises.ipynb`](bsa_lab_week_2_exercises.ipynb) in Google Colab (click on the notebook, then click on the "Open in Colab" button.

## Exercises

All exercises can be found in the notebook. The queries relate to two datasets:

* **World Cup**: You will do these queries during the lab.
* **Titanic**: These are just extra exercises that you can do on your own if you feel like you need more practice.

Solutions to both series of questions will be released at the end of the week.
