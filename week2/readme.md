For this week we will do a recap on SQL. We will try to exercise some SQL queries together in the lab. 

__SQL:__

For this weeks lab we will use SQLite databases (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). They can be used easily, and you can simply read csv files (or any other type of files) on your local machine with pandas and then load them as a SQLite database. It is possible to query SQLite databases in jupyter notebook. For that you will need to install sqlite widget for jupyter notebook. However, we recommend you to use colab as this widget is already installed there. Now you can easily open the notebooks in github in colab, You just need to click on the "open in colab" button on the top. We will practice several queries on the FIFA world cup 2010 data-set and Titanic data-set. Open "SQL_Assignment" notebook to start today's exercise.
