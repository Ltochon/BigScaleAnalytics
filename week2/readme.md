# SQL on the Cloud: Google BigQuery

This week, we will first cover a quick recap of the SQL syntax and see how we can run SQL queries from Colab notebooks. Then we will see how to use Google BigQuery more in depth and how we to access it from our notebooks.

## Goals

* Get reacquainted with the SQL syntax to prepare you for the upcoming assignment
* Create and query an SQLite database using Python
* Learn how BigQuery works (data upload and exploration)
* Strengthen SQL knowledge by querying a public dataset on BigQuery

## Lab Structure

1. SQL recap and basic queries in Colab
2. Access to Google Cloud
3. BigQuery walkthrough
4. Exercises

## Walkthrough

The walkthrough will be done directly on the Google BigQuery console, as well as on the BigQuery notebook. We have also added some slides containing all the information you need to get you started in BigQuery. You can use the SQL notebook to refresh your SQL skills.
