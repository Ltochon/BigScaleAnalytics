# Introduction to cloud services

Welcome to the first BSA lab! In this week, we will give you a brief overview of what cloud-based services can offer. More specifically, we will look into **Microsoft Azure** and **Google Cloud**, two of the most popular cloud services platforms.

## Goals

* [Register on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bigscaleanalytics2021/shared_invite/zt-kwpnsx1t-bIpVtJfzw6N_82CNFI2jHQ). This will be our main communication channel.
* Create an account on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) and get a student subscription (you will receive a free $100 credit for one year).
* Create an account on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). **Note**: For that, you will need to enter your credit card information, but you won't be charged. It is just to verify that you are not a bot. You will receive a free $300 credit valid for one year. See also [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/?modal_active=none) for classes on Google Cloud for students.
* Do some simple exercises using the cloud.

You are going to use these services all throughout the semester, so make sure that you have created your accounts by the end of the week. After having made an account, try to explore the various features you see in Azure and Google Cloud.

**Highly recommended**: If at any point you feel lost while using these services, we encourage you to look at the documentation provided by [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs). They are rich resources that teach you how to use their services, along with numerous code examples.

## Lab Structure
Hour 1:
1. Introduction of TAs
2. Students register to the slack webpage
3. Walkthroughs to the Cloud services
4. Small group exercise on Cloud Storage (breakouts 5mins)

Hour2:
5. Presentation of project
6. Group exercise on Cloud Functions (breakouts 15mins)

## Walkthroughs
We will start with a walkthrough of Google Cloud services. Important topics that will be covered are:

* IntroductÎ¹on to cloud platforms and showing how to create an account on Google Cloud.
* Introduction to Google Cloud console and have a walkthrough of its different sections.
* Introducing the billing section, where you can see your expenses.
* Going a bit more deep into parts of the console which are more important to us, i.e., Storage, Big Data and AI.
* Uploading a new dataset to the Google Cloud storage.
* Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery. Query a dataset you uploaded (or a public dataset) with SQL.
* Showing usage examples of natural language and translation and vision APIs in Google Cloud (in case we got enough time).

For a walkthrough on Microsoft Azure, check the document in the Git folder.

## Exercises

### Storage in Google Cloud

* Go to _Storage_ > _Storage_ and create a new bucket.
* Upload a CSV from your laptop (either an existing one or one that you create for that purpose).
* Change the permissions so that the file is readable by everyone (i.e., "Public").
* Access the CSV file from your browser using the public URL.
* Remove the previously set permission.

### Cloud functions
* Go _Compute_ > _Cloud Functions_.
* Create a simple Python function that can be triggered over HTTP.
   * The function should accept one parameter called `company_stock_name` and call the following external API, using that parameter as the value for the `symbol` parameter: https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=MSFT&apikey=demo. "demo" should be replaced with your own API key, which you can get for free [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
   * The function should return the last recorded value of the company's stock.
* Call your function using its URL, trying different values for the company name (MSFT, IBM, ZM, etc.) to make sure it works properly.
