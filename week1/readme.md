# Introduction to cloud services

Welcome to the first BSA lab! In this week, we will give you a brief overview of cloud-based services. More specifically, we will look into **Google Cloud**, one of the most popular cloud services platforms. 

ðŸ’³ <u>Please bring your credit card to this lab or register on your own for your google cloud account from home before the lab.</u> 

## To do

* [Register on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bigscaleanalytics2022/shared_invite/zt-1408kz52b-wwcCsi4qgixLaVDh~FpcxA). This will be our main communication channel.
* Create an account on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). This needs to be a google account.
* **Note**: For the Google Cloud account, you will have to enter your credit card information, but you won't be charged. It is just to verify that you are not a bot. Upon joining, you will receive a free $300 credit valid for 3 months. See also [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/?modal_active=none) for classes on Google Cloud for students.
* Do some simple exercises using the cloud.

You are going to use this services all throughout the semester, so make sure that you have created your account by the end of the week. Afterwards try to explore the various features you see in Google Cloud.

**Highly recommended**: If at any point you feel lost while using this service, we encourage you to look at the documentation provided by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/docs). They teach you how to use their services, and provide numerous code examples.

## Lab Structure

**Hour 1**:

1. Introduction of TAs
2. Students register on the course Slack
3. Walkthrough of cloud services
4. Small group exercise on Google cloud storage (5 min. in breakout rooms)

**Hour 2**:

5. Group exercise on Google cloud functions (15 min. in breakout rooms)

## Walkthroughs

We will start with a walkthrough of Google Cloud services. Topics covered:

* IntroductÎ¹on to the Google Cloud platform and howing how to create an account on Google Cloud.
* Introduction to Google Cloud console and have a walkthrough of its different sections.
* Introducing the billing section, where you can see your expenses.
* Going a bit more deep into parts of the console which are more important to us, i.e., Storage, Big Data and AI.
* Uploading a new dataset to the Google Cloud storage.
* Showing usage examples of natural language and translation and vision APIs in Google Cloud (in case we got enough time).


## Exercises
These should be conducted in groups of three.

### Exercise 1: Storage in Google Cloud

* From the side menu, go to _Storage_ > _Storage_ and create a new bucket. Besides a unique name, you can keep the default configuration (but read through it anyway to see what kind of options are available to you).
* Upload a CSV from your laptop (either an existing one or one that you create for that purpose).
* Change the permissions so that the file is readable by everyone (i.e., "Public").
* Access the CSV file from your browser using the public URL.
* Remove the previously set permission.

### Exercise 2: Cloud functions

* From the side menu, go to _Compute_ > _Cloud Functions_.
* Create a simple Python function that can be triggered over HTTP. Make sure to pick the "Allow unauthenticated invocations" option.
   * The function should accept one parameter called `company_stock_name` and call the following external API, using that parameter as the value for the `symbol` parameter: https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=MSFT&apikey=demo. "demo" should be replaced with your own API key, which you can get for free [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
   * The function should return the last recorded value of the company's stock.
* After having deployed your function, call it using its URL, trying different values for the company name (MSFT, IBM, ZM, etc.) to make sure it works properly.

**Hints**:
* Build on top of the default code provided by Google; no need to start from scratch! See also here for using [Cloud functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqd6n-V7LTI)
* Make sure the "Entry point" matches the name of the Python function in `main.py`.
* Try the API link above to see what the returned object looks like. It will make it easier for you to understand how to access the desired data from your code. You may also want to look into Python's default [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) library.
* There are several ways to make HTTP requests from Python. You can use the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library, for example.
* To go back to your code after having deployed the function, you must go to your list of cloud functions, click the function, then click the "Edit" button at the top. The console will ask you to review the configuration first; you can simply click "Next".

**Entirely optional (will not be covered this time)**:
* If you'd like to check out a different cloud service, you can also have a look on your own at **Microsoft Azure**. For a walkthrough of Microsoft Azure, check the document in this Git folder in your own time.
* Create an account on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) and get a student subscription (you will receive a free $100 credit for one year).
* The documentation is available here: [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).
