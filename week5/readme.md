# Week 5: Entity resolution (or record linkage, or deduplication)

This week, we are going to work on entity resolution. There are plenty of different names for this topic. We would highly recommend
you take a look at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) page. 

We will explore together how to deduplicate datasets using the [recordlinkage](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python library.

## Goals

* Learn the basic usage of the `recordlinkage` Python library
* Become aware of various blocking, comparison and classification methods

## Lab Structure

**Hour 1**:

1. Questions about last week's lab?
2. Questions about the project?
3. Record linkage walkthrough (part 1)

**Hour 2**:

4. Briefing about the personal assignment

In case we finish the lab earlier, students can use the remaining time to work on their project.
