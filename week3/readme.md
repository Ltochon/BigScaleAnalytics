# Entity resolution (or record linkage, or deduplication)

This week, we are going to work on entity resolution. There are plenty of different names for this topic. We would highly recommend
you take a look at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) page. 

We will explore together how to deduplicate datasets using the [recordlinkage](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Python library.
