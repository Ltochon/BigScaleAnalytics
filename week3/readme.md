# SQL on the Cloud: Google BigQuery

In this week, we will cover Google BigQuery more in depth and see how we can access it from an iPython notebook.

## Goals

* Learn how BigQuery works (data upload and exploration)
* Strengthen SQL knowledge by querying a public dataset on BigQuery

## Lab Structure

**Hour 1**:

1. Questions about last week's lab?
2. Project: Short update from each group
3. Project: Questions?
4. Access to Google Cloud?
5. BigQuery walkthrough

**Hour 2**:

6. Exercises (15 min. in breakout rooms)
7. Solutions (presented by students)
8. Remaining exercises (15 min. in breakout rooms)
9. Solutions (presented by students)

## Walkthrough

The walkthrough will be done directly on the Google BigQuery console, as well as on this week's notebook. We have also added some slides containing all the information you need to get you started in BigQuery.

**Topics**:

* Adding your own data to BigQuery
* Querying publicly available data
* Using BigQuery from a notebook

## Exercises

All exercises can be found in the notebook. The queries relate to the "NHTSA Traffic Fatalities" public dataset found in BigQuery. The solutions will be released at the end of the week.
